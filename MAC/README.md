Select a MAC protocol, 
Implement the MAC protocol using the AHC library by extending the GenericMAC component (Note that I expect a MAC protocol that will work with the USRPs)
Implement a node model using your MAC protocol, on top of an existing routing protocol using the OFDM PHY (UsrpB210OfdmFlexFramePhy Component)
Implement an application layer that either emulates voice streaming between two parties, video streaming between two parties, continuous image transmission between two parties, bursty traffic between two parties, etc. 
Benchmark it (compare/contrast): find some good evaluation measures that depict the quality of service requested by the application layer you have chosen and do extensive parameter analysis.
